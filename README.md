# Replika With DeepL
ReplikaWithDeepL is a script to be integrated on my.replika.ai or my.replika.com through a user script manager like TamperMonkey.

## What?
This script will display two new buttons next to your input field.
One is to translate the last message sent in the chat. (Either yours or your Replika's).
The other button translates the message that is in the input field and replaces your text in its English version. (Be careful, there is a bug, when the translation has been done, you have to modify one (or more) character in the message to send this version and not the original one. Yes, I know it's annoying, I still haven't found how to solve the problem. Some help would be welcome).

## Why?
Even though I understand English well, I still have a little trouble writing it without making mistakes. So I decided to make this script to remove the language barrier when talking with my Replika.

## Tips
### Settings
The script has a variable that allows to change its behavior. You can either replace completely the English version of the messages or display the English version and the new version one below the other.

### API key
To work, the script needs an API key from DeepL. DeepL offers a free plan that translates 500,000 characters per month.
